EXPERIENCE
Machine Learning Engineer – Boehringer Ingelheim, Athens, Georgia, USA January 2025 - July 2025
Engineered scalable RAG architecture using Llama-3, GPT-4o, and Nova Lite that automatically extracted key themes from 10k+
employee survey responses, enabling data-driven leadership decisions through contextually-aware response generation
Improved chatbot throughput by 80% through asynchronous FastAPI endpoints and vLLM continuous batching, containerized via
Docker and scaled across multi-GPU clusters using Ray for parallel workload distribution
Developed an automated AirFlow data engineering pipeline (scraping, cleaning, chunking, and vector embedding) with nightly updates
and drift-triggered retraining, ensuring high-quality model inputs and reducing inaccuracies
Leveraged AWS CloudWatch, Grafana, and Prometheus to design comprehensive monitoring and alerting systems, decreasing
incident resolution time by 40% and achieving 95% SLA compliance
Data Scientist - Yunometa, Mumbai, India August 2022 - July 2023
Modernized legacy API into a cloud-native microservices architecture using Django, AWS (EKS), Docker & Kubernetes with
oAuth 2.0 security, accelerating loan approval processes by 70% through real-time risk assessment
Engineered advanced SQL queries in AWS (Athena, Redshift, S3, Druid) to optimize management of 10M+ records from
government APIs, enhancing stakeholder data visibility and decision-making capabilities
Developed scalable data transformation pipeline using Apache Spark, AWS(EMR, Lambda) and PostgreSQL to ingest, cleanse, and
standardize massive datasets, improving preprocessing efficiency by 40%
Increased text extraction accuracy by 70% for multilingual documents by training a Faster R-CNN model using PyTorch and
OpenCV, significantly enhancing document processing capabilities
Data Scientist - Kritexco, Mumbai, India December 2021 - March 2022
Analyzed 50k+ dataset from OpenSea and Rarible using Python and Matplotlib, extracting insights on NFT sales trends. Visualized
findings in Tableau, resulting in better decision making
Built and deployed an LSTM model using Tensorflow for predicting NFT prices with an RMSE score of 386, resulting in a 20%
improvement in price accuracy compared to traditional methods
Collaborated closely with stakeholders and cross-functional teams to identify data requirements, design scalable data pipelines, and
ensure data accuracy and integrity through development, test, and production environments
Machine Learning Engineer- Aadyam Infotech, Pune, India June 2021 - August 2021
Formulated regular expressions, leveraged Azure AI, and engineered an NLP pipeline that parses and extracts key information from
unstructured documents, and achieved an accuracy of 86% for extracted records
Worked with cross-functional teams in an agile environment to develop and brainstorm optimization strategies for the algorithm
